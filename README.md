# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) written entirely in C.

My primary objective going in was to solve every problem in C with the hope that it would be refreshing to implement some structures/algorithms from scratch. However, my additional ulterior objective was to have a relatively low cumulative runtime across each day (without overkilling the problem).

Of course runtimes vary depending on hardware, so to specify, I aimed for a cumulative 1 second on my laptop, which has an i5-8265U. In the end (after some slight optimization), I ended up with an average total of ~900ms for both parts on all days.

## My Results
Here is one sample of my incredibly unscientific tests. The slowest days were 15, 19, and 23. Given enough time I might be able to come up with something faster, but I am satisfied with my current solutions.

| Day | Runtime (ms) |
|-------|-------|
|     1 | 0.006 |
|     2 | 0.006 |
|     3 | 0.006 |

## Conclusion

This month was a very fun challenge, and I enjoyed pursuing the goals I had set for myself. I look forward to participating again next year!
